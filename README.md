# .NET Clean Architecture Project Structure


# Database Integration Enhancement ðŸš€

## Overview

We're thrilled to announce a significant enhancement to our application: the integration with various databases including Oracle, MySQL, MSSQL, and PostgreSQL! This expansion unlocks new possibilities and empowers our application to thrive in diverse environments.

## Folder Structure

To streamline our database operations and ensure clarity, we've organized our database contexts within a dedicated folder named `DbContext`. This structured approach enhances manageability and simplifies navigation within our codebase.

## Migration Script

### Running Migrations

To facilitate seamless migration management across different database contexts, we've devised a straightforward script. Below is an example of how to execute migrations for the MSSQL database context:

`bash`
add-migration InitialAspNetIdentityMigration -c MsSqlDatabaseContext
update-database -context MsSqlDatabaseContext


This repository provides a structured approach to kickstart your .NET projects, facilitating faster development and eliminating the initial project structuring hurdles by employing the clean architecture pattern.

## Repository Structure

The repository consists of two main solution folders:

### src

The `src` folder encapsulates the core implementation of the application. It is organized into five projects:

1. **Application**: Contains the business logic, entities, domain services, and interfaces.
2. **Domain**: Defines the database entity models.
3. **Persistence**: Implements interfaces and repositories defined in the Application layer, utilizing frameworks like Entity Framework or Dapper.
4. **Infrastructure**: Houses the software logic responsible for communication with the Data Plane through a software interface.

## Extension Classes

In order to reduce the code clutter in the `program.cs` class, extension classes have been introduced to each of the class libraries. These extensions include:

- `PersistenceServiceRegistration`
- `ApplicationServiceRegistration`
- `SwaggerServiceRegistration`
- `InfrastructureServicesRegistration`

These extensions aim to enhance code organization and readability by abstracting service registrations into separate files within each class library.

### test

The `test` folder contains the test project, enabling comprehensive testing of the application's functionalities.
